    "\n",
    " You can create a cell and then toggle its location by using the upwards arrow at the right side of the cell in command mode(Shortcut: CTRL+M K) or the downwards arrow(shortcut:CTRL+M J) To delete a cell, simply select the corresponding cell and remove it via Edit -> Delete Cells. (Keyboard Shortcut: Click on the cell, then press \"d\" twice).\n",

    "Markdown language is a markup language(superset of HTML), which is used for text formatting in different contexts. In Jupyter Notebook we use markdown cell to format text in the same document as python code which helps with the documentation of the code. In fact, all text written so far in this notebook is using markdown cells.\n",
